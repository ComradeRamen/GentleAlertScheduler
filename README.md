# GentleAlertScheduler

A simple desktop application for scheduling alerts on Windows. When an alert triggers, it displays a semi-transparent click-through overlay that gently expands to cover the screen over a configured duration.

## Features

* Schedule alerts with specific dates, times, and recurrence (daily, weekly, monthly).
* Customize overlay appearance: expansion time, duration, transparency, color, start size, and optional text.
* Configure default settings for new alerts.
* Manage alerts via a table interface (add, edit, remove, test).
* System tray icon for basic control (stop/delay active alerts, open scheduler, exit).

## Building

This project uses Python with PyQt5. A GitHub Actions workflow is included in `.github/workflows/` to automatically build a Windows executable using PyInstaller upon manual trigger or tag push. The built executable can be found in the Releases section.
